TODO v.0.5:

- rework for stone/gravel:
  stone -> crush -> gravel
	dirt can't be crafted to gravel anymore
	stone fields give: rocks, gravel, dirt
	rocks can be easily crushed to bricks+gravel
	gravel needs furnaces to craft to bricks

- different resource fields with various products
- implement process for DyTech / bobs ore?
- implement newer graphics (See graphics folder)
